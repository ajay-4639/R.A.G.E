ACME Corp Technical Documentation

ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
The ACME platform is built on a microservices architecture running on Kubernetes.
Each service communicates via gRPC for internal calls and REST for external APIs.
The system handles approximately 10,000 requests per second at peak load.

DATABASE LAYER
Primary database: PostgreSQL 15 with read replicas for scaling.
Cache layer: Redis cluster for session management and frequently accessed data.
Search engine: Elasticsearch for full-text search and product catalog queries.
Vector database: Qdrant for AI-powered semantic search and recommendations.

AUTHENTICATION
OAuth 2.0 with PKCE flow for web and mobile applications.
API keys with rate limiting for third-party integrations.
JWT tokens with 15-minute expiration and refresh token rotation.
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is mandatory for admin accounts.

API RATE LIMITS
Free tier: 100 requests per minute
Pro tier: 1,000 requests per minute
Enterprise tier: 10,000 requests per minute
Burst allowance: 2x tier limit for up to 10 seconds

DEPLOYMENT PIPELINE
All code changes go through automated CI/CD pipeline.
Test coverage requirement: minimum 80% for all services.
Staging environment mirrors production at 1/10th scale.
Blue-green deployments with automatic rollback on failure.
Feature flags managed through LaunchDarkly for gradual rollouts.

MONITORING AND ALERTING
Prometheus for metrics collection with 30-day retention.
Grafana dashboards for real-time system visibility.
PagerDuty integration for on-call incident management.
SLO: 99.95% uptime for core services measured monthly.
